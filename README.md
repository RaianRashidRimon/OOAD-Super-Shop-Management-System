# 🛍️ Object-Oriented Analysis & Design for Super Shop Management System

## 📌 Overview

The Super Shop Management System is an Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) project that models the operations of a retail store using UML diagrams. This project provides a structured system design, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and efficiency in a real-world supermarket environment.

By applying OOAD principles, the project defines interactions between key system components, including customers, employees, and inventory management. The analysis includes identifying core system functionalities, optimizing workflows, and enhancing operational efficiency. Serving as a blueprint for developing an automated super shop system, this project offers valuable insights into software architecture and best design practices.
